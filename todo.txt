1. High-cost routines are:
    b. PropagationMatchFiler::processCell
    c. rbow::DataBase::query - use a smaller set of kpoints for this. The subset may be created with adaptive NMS.
2. For image pair refine, try use all PMF matches and Cauthy robust function
3. sometimes it deadlock and stucks in the last stage
